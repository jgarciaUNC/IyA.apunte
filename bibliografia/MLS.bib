The chapter explains a definitive description of the microwave landing system (MLS) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) signal format. The international standards are accepted by an ICAO worldwide meeting in April 1981. The technical rational that permits the system to achieve its objectives are presented in some detail to show that MLS design is completely integrated to meet a wide variety of requirements and is fundamentally sound. The configuration of MLS, and their coverage and accuracy is summarized. Individual requirements placed on the ground equipment, airborne equipment, and those allocated to the propagation path is described under the system design considerations. The chapter presents the draft standards and recommended practices (SARPS) form a concise description of a basic and an expanded MLS configuration. The design of the MLS system is based on thorough analysis, and test that have provided a complete and fundamentally sound system specification in equipments that can be implemented. The requirements of the specification are traceable to the basic physics of the landing operation. The design of MLS resulted from the efforts of the many government agencies and laboratories involved, as well as the many participating industrial contractors both in the United States and abroad. The chapter concludes with the discussion of the rationale for the accuracy requirements, the sources of error in MLS, the factors that affect the power received at the aircraft, the considerations in siting an MLS system in existing airport configurations, examples of MLS performance, and the monitoring of the signal to provide system integrity.}
