Antennas

It may not be apparent from an inspection of the
external profile of an aircraft that most large
aircraft carry several dozen antennas of different
types. To illustrate this point, Figure 2.1 shows
just a few of the antennas carried by a Boeing
757. What should be apparent from this is that
many of the antennas are of the low-profile
variety which is essential to reduce drag.
Antennas are used both for transmission and
reception. A transmitting antenna converts the
high frequency electrical energy supplied to it
into electromagnetic energy which is launched or
radiated into the space surrounding the antenna.
A receiving antenna captures the electromagnetic
energy in the surrounding space and converts this
into high frequency electrical energy which is
then passed on to the receiving system. The law
of reciprocity indicates that an antenna will have
the same gain and directional properties when
used for transmission as it does when used for
reception.

2.1 The isotropic radiator
The most fundamental form of antenna (which
cannot be realised in practice) is the isotropic
radiator. This theoretical type of antenna is often
used for comparison purposes and as a reference
when calculating the gain and directional
characteristics of a real antenna.
Isotropic antennas radiate uniformly in all
directions. In other words, when placed at the
centre of a sphere such an antenna would
illuminate the internal surface of the sphere
uniformly, as shown in Figure 2.2(a). All
practical antennas have directional characteristics
as illustrated in Figure 2.2(b). Furthermore, such
characteristics may be more or less pronounced
according to the antenna’s application. We shall
look at antenna gain and directivity in more detail
later on, but before we do that we shall introduce
you to some common types of antenna.

2.2 The half-wave dipole

The half-wave dipole is one of the most
fundamental types of antenna. The half-wave
dipole antenna (Figure 2.3) consists of a single
conductor having a length equal to one-half of the
length of the wave being transmitted or received.
The conductor is then split in the centre to enable
connection to the feeder. In practice, because of
the capacitance effects between the ends of the
antenna and ground, the antenna is cut a
little shorter than a half wavelength.

The length of the antenna (from end to end) is
equal to one half wavelength, hence:

Now since v = f λ we can conclude that, for a
half-wave dipole:

Note that l is the electrical length of the antenna
rather than its actual physical length. End effects, or capacitance effects at the ends of the antenna
require that we reduce the actual length of the
aerial, and a 5% reduction in length is typically
required for an aerial to be resonant at the centre
of its designed tuning range.
Figure 2.4 shows the distribution of current
and voltage along the length of a half-wave
dipole aerial. The current is maximum at the
centre and zero at the ends. The voltage is zero at
the centre and maximum at the ends. This implies that the impedance is not constant along
the length of aerial but varies from a maximum at
the ends (maximum voltage, minimum current)
to a minimum at the centre.
The dipole antenna has directional properties,
illustrated in Figures 2.5 to 2.7. Figure 2.5 shows
the radiation pattern of the antenna in the plane
of the antenna’s electric field (i.e. the E-field
plane) whilst Figure 2.6 shows the radiation
pattern in the plane of the antenna’s magnetic
field (i.e. the H-field plane).
The 3D plot shown in Figure 2.7 combines
these two plots into a single ‘doughnut’ shape.
Things to note from these three diagrams are
that:

in the case of Figure 2.5, minimum radiation
occurs along the axis of the antenna whilst the
two zones of maximum radiation are at 90°
(i.e. are ‘normal to’) the dipole elements

in the case of Figure 2.6, the antenna radiates
uniformly in all directions.

Hence, a vertical dipole will have omni-
directional characteristics whilst a horizontal
dipole will have a bi-directional radiation
pattern. This is an important point as we shall see
later.

Example 2.1

Determine the length of a half-wave dipole
antenna for use at a frequency of 150 MHz.

The length of a half-wave dipole for 150 MHz
can be determined from:

Test your understanding 2.1

Determine the length of a half-wave dipole for
frequencies of (a) 121 MHz and (b) 11.25 MHz.

2.3 Impedance and radiation resistance

Because voltage and current appear in an antenna
(a minute voltage and current in the case of a
receiving antenna and a much larger voltage and
current in the case of a transmitting antenna) an
aerial is said to have impedance. Here it’s worth
remembering that impedance is a mixture of
resistance, R, and reactance, X, both measured in
ohms (Ω). Of these two quantities, X varies with
frequency whilst R remains constant. This is an
important concept because it explains why
antennas are often designed for operation over a
restricted range of frequencies.

The impedance, Z, of an aerial is the ratio of
the voltage, E, across its terminals to the current,
I, flowing in it. Hence:

You might infer from Figure 2.7 that the
impedance at the centre of the half-wave dipole
should be zero. In practice the impedance is
usually between 70 Ω and 75 Ω. Furthermore, at
resonance the impedance is purely resistive and
contains no reactive component (i.e. inductance and capacitance). In this case X is negligible
compared with R. It is also worth noting that the
DC resistance (or ohmic resistance) of an
antenna is usually very small in comparison with
its impedance and so it may be ignored. Ignoring
the DC resistance of the antenna, the impedance
of an antenna may be regarded as its radiation
resistance, R r (see Figure 2.8).

Radiation resistance is important because it is
through this resistance that electrical power is
transformed into radiated electromagnetic energy
(in the case of a transmitting antenna) and
incident electromagnetic energy is transformed
into electrical power (in the case of a receiving
aerial).

The equivalent circuit of an antenna is shown
in Figure 2.9. The three series-connected
components that make up the antenna’s
impedance are:

the DC resistance, R d.c.

the radiation resistance, R r

the ‘off-tune’ reactance, X.

Note that when the antenna is operated at a
frequency that lies in the centre of its pass-band
(i.e. when it is on-tune) the off-tune reactance is
zero. It is also worth bearing in mind that the
radiation resistance of a half-wave dipole varies
according to its height above ground. The 70 Ω
to 75 Ω impedance normally associated with a
half-wave dipole is only realised when the
antenna is mounted at an elevation of 0.2
wavelengths, or more.

Test your understanding 2.2
A half-wave dipole is operated at its centre
frequency (zero off-tune reactance). If the antenna
has a total DC loss resistance of 2.5 Ω and is
supplied with a current of 2 A and a voltage of
25 V, determine:
(a) the radiation resistance of the antenna
(b) the power loss in the antenna.
