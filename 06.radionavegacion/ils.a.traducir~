Instrument landing system

The instrument landing system (ILS) is used for
precision approaches and landings. The system
uses a combination of VHF and UHF radio waves
and has been in operation since 1946. In this
chapter we will look at ILS principles and
hardware in detail, concluding with how the ILS
combines with the automatic flight control system
(AFCS) to provide fully automatic approach and
landing.
12.1 ILS overview
The instrument landing system is used for the
final approach and is based on directional
beams propagated from two transmitters at the
airfield, see Figure 12.1. One transmitter (the
glide slope) provides guidance in the vertical
plane and has a range of approximately 10 nm.
The second transmitter (the localizer) guides
the aircraft in the horizontal plane. In addition
to the directional beams, two or three marker
beacons are located at key points on the
extended runway centreline defined by the
localizer, see Figure 12.4.

12.2.1 Localizer transmitter

The localizer transmits in the VHF frequency
range, 108â€“112 MHz in 0.5 MHz increments.
Note that this is the same frequency range as used
by the VOR system (see Chapter 10). Although
the two systems are completely independent and
work on totally different principles, they often
share the same receiver. The two systems are
differentiated by their frequency allocations
within this range. ILS frequencies are allocated to
the odd tenths of each 0.5 MHz increment, e.g.
109.10 MHz, 109.15 MHz, 109.30 MHz, etc.
VOR frequencies are allocated to the even tenths
of each 0.5 MHz increment, e.g. 109.20 MHz, 109.40 MHz, 109.60 MHz, etc. Table 12.1
provides an illustration of how these frequencies
are allocated within the 109 MHz range. This
pattern applies from 108 to 111.95 MHz.
The localizer antenna is located at the far end
of the runway and transmits two lobes to the left
and right of the runway centreline modulated at
90 Hz and 150 Hz respectively. On the extended
runway centreline, see Figure 12.2, the combined
depth of modulation is equal. Either side of the
centreline will produce a difference in depth of
modulation (DDM); this difference is directly
proportional to the deviation on either side of the
extended centreline of the runway. The localizer
