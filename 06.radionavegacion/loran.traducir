Within each of these multi-pulse groups from the master and slave stations, the phase of the RF carrier is changed with respect to the pulse envelope in a systematic manner from pulse-to-pulse. The phase of each pulse in an eight or nine-pulse group is changed in accordance with a prescribed code so that it is either in phase (+) or 180? out of phase (-) with a stable 100 kc/s reference signal. The phase code used at a master station is different from the phase code used at a slave, but all slave stations use the same code and currently (1962) all LORAN-C chains use the same code. The sequence utilized in a typical LORAN-C star chain is given below:
The use of phase-coded pulses by the system provides a measure of protection against interference from outside sources and also reduces contamination of the groundwave of pulses transmitted subsequent to skywaves from preceding pulses; i.e., skywave of the first pulse arriving at the same time as the groundwave of the second pulse. Contamination by preceding skywaves without phase coding would nullify the effect of sampling only the groundwave, thereby degrading the inherent accuracy of the system. The use of phase coding also provides the receiver with necessary logical information for automatic search for the master and slave signals. Automatic search can be utilized for convenience or when the signal- to-noise ratio of the received signals precludes visual identification.
