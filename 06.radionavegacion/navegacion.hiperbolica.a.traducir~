Hyperbolic radio navigation

Hyperbolic radio navigation systems provide
medium- to long-range position fix capabilities
for en route operations. Several hyperbolic
systems have been developed for aviation use
since the 1940s, including Decca, Omega and
Loran. The operational use of Omega and
Decca navigation systems ceased in 1997 and
2000 respectively. Enhanced Loran (eLoran)
has been proposed as a complementary
navigation aid for global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS).
