Microwave landing system

The microwave landing system (MLS) was
adopted in 1978 as the long-term instrument
landing system’s (ILS) replacement. MLS is
based on the principle of time referenced scanning
beams and provides precision navigation guidance
for approach and landing. The system provides
three-dimensional approach guidance, i.e.
azimuth, elevation and range; it also provides
multiple approach angles for both azimuth and
elevation guidance. Despite the advantages of
MLS, it has not yet been introduced on a
worldwide basis for commercial aircraft, primarily
due to the advent of global navigation satellite
systems (GNSS). In this chapter, we will review
MLS principles and discuss its advantages over
the ILS.
13.1 MLS overview
MLS was introduced to overcome a number of
problems and limitations associated with ILS.
The principle of MLS allows curved, or
segmented approaches in azimuth together with
selectable glide slope angles. All of these features
are beneficial in mountainous regions, or for
environmental reasons, e.g. over residential areas
of a town or city. MLS installations are not
affected by ground vehicles or taxiing aircraft
passing through the beam as with the localizer.
Aircraft making an approach using ILS in low
visibility have to maintain sufficient separation to
preserve the integrity of the localizer beams; with
MLS, this separation is not required. The
combination of all these features allows for
increased air traffic control flexibility and higher
take-off and landing rates for a given airfield.
Two ground transmitters provide azimuth and
elevation guidance; these scanning beams extend
the coverage for an approach compared with the
ILS, see Figure 13.1.

13.2 MLS principles
The system is based on the principle of time
referenced scanning beams and operates in the C-
band at 5 GHz. Two directional fan-shaped
beams are used for azimuth and elevation
guidance. The azimuth approach transmitter is
located at the stop end of the runway; the
elevation transmitter is located near the threshold
of the runway. Azimuth scanning is through ±40°
either side of the runway centreline with a range
of 20 nm, see Figure 13.2(a). An expansion
capability can extend azimuth coverage to ±60°,
but with a reduced range of 14 nm. Elevation
scanning sweeps over an angle of 15 degrees
(with 20 degrees as an option) providing
coverage up to 20,000 feet, see Figure 13.2(b).
At the aircraft receiver, a pulse is detected each
time the respective beams sweep past the aircraft.
Consider an aircraft on the approach as illustrated
in Figure 13.3. The (azimuth) time referenced
scanning beam sweeps from left to right (‘TO’),
and then returns from right to left (‘FRO’). If the
aircraft is in position A, it is to the right of the
centreline (from the pilot’s perspective) and will
receive a pulse at time interval t 1 as the beam
sweeps ‘TO’, and then at time t 2 when the beam
sweeps ‘FRO’. The two pulses are therefore close
together with the aircraft to the right of centreline.
If the aircraft were in position B, i.e. to the left of
the centreline, it would receive pulses at t 3 and t 4
due to the relative position of the aircraft.
The aircraft receiver in a given aircraft will
interpret the timing of each pulse in terms of when
they occurred and the time difference between each
pulse. These pulse timings provide a precise
position fix for the aircraft with respect to the
runway centreline. Elevation guidance is calculated
in the same way as in azimuth, except that the
beam is scanning up and down. Timing signals are
referenced to a selected elevation approach angle.

Referring to Figure 13.4 and Table 13.1, the
pulse timing technique is used to determine the
lateral positions of three aircraft, A, B and C. Figure
13.4 is a simplified illustration of the transmitter
and its beam sweep either side of the runway
centreline, and timing of the TO/FRO beam as it
sweeps through the ±40°. (Runway omitted to
simplify the illustration.) The illustration shows the
TO sweep sub-divided into eight segments, 1–8; the
FRO (return) sweep is sub-divided into eight
segments, 9–16. The TO sweep reaches aircraft C at
a count of 2, and then continues across to a count of
8; it then returns as the FRO sweep, reaching
aircraft C at a count of 14. The time delta between
each count (or pulse, in accordance with Figure
13.3) is 14 − 2 = 12. The positions of aircraft B and
C are calculated in the same way; the results of this
illustration are summarised in Table 13.1.
