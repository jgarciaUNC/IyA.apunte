Weather radar

Weather radar was introduced onto passenger
aircraft during the 1950s for pilots to identify
weather conditions and subsequently reroute for
the safety and comfort of passengers. Extreme
weather conditions are a major threat to the safe
operation of an aircraft; flight crews need to be
aware of these conditions and understand the
consequences. There are three main technologies
typically used in aircraft to detect weather
conditions: on-board radar, lightning detection,
and datalink services. These systems enable
pilots to identify weather conditions and
subsequently re-route for the safety and comfort
of passengers. The majority of commercial
transport aircraft are equipped with weather
radar, and this represents the majority of this
chapter. General Aviation aircraft that are not
equipped with radar are typically equipped with
an alternative technology, i.e. lightning detection,
and/or datalink services.

20.1 System overview

The word radar is derived from radio detection
and ranging; the initial use of radar was to locate
aircraft and display their range and bearing on a
monitor (either ground based or in another
aircraft). This type of radar is termed primary
radar; energy is directed via an antenna to a
‘target’; this target could be an aircraft, the
ground or specific weather conditions. In the case
of weather radar, we want to detect the energy
reflected back from the contents of a cloud, or
from precipitation, see Figure 20.1. The latter
may defined as the result of water vapour
condensing in the atmosphere that subsequently
falls to the earth’s surface. Precipitation can occur
in many different forms including: rain, freezing
rain, snow, sleet, and hail. Weather radar operates
either in the C-band (4–8GHz) or X-band (8–12.5
GHz); these two bands have their advantages and
disadvantages for use in weather radar applications. C-band microwave energy pulses can penetrate through heavy precipitation, thereby providing weather detection, enabling the pilot
to determine more details of the weather pattern.
X-band microwave energy pulses can provide
good resolution of images; however, this means
that they can only be used for weather
avoidance. Higher frequencies require a smaller
antenna; for this reason, larger passenger aircraft
use X-band radar.
The range of a weather radar system is
typically 320 miles. Microwave energy pulses are
reflected from the moisture droplets and returned
to the radar antenna. The system calculates the
time taken for the energy pulses to be returned;
this is displayed as an image on a dedicated
weather radar screen, or the image can be
integrated with the electronic flight display
system. The strength of the returned energy is
measured and used to determine the size of the
target. Higher moisture content in a cloud
provides higher returned energy. The antenna is
scanned in the lateral plane to provide directional
information about the target.

20.2 Airborne equipment

The typical weather radar system in a large
aircraft comprises the antenna (nose cone); two
transceivers (nose cone); two control panels/
displays (cockpit), see Figure 20.2. The
transceivers are located in the nose cone, thereby
minimising the length of the waveguide, and also
avoiding the need for the waveguide to penetrate
the pressure bulkhead. On single engine, GA
aircraft the antenna can be located on the wing, in
a self-contained pod.

20.2.1 Antenna

Microwave signals are transmitted and received
via the antenna. Early versions of the antenna
were in the form of a parabolic dish; however, the
current versions are the planar array flat-plate
type, see Figure 20.3(a). The flat-plate antenna
projects a more focused beam than the parabolic
type; this is due to the reduction in side-lobes as
illustrated in Figure 20.4. The antenna comprises
a flat steerable plate with a large number of
radiating slots, each equivalent to a half-wave
dipole fed in phase. The antenna is mounted on
the forward pressure bulkhead behind the radome;
