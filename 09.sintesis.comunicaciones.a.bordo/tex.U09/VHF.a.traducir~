VHF communications


Very high frequency (VHF) radio has long been the primary means of communication between aircraft and the ground. The system operates in the frequency range extending from 1 1 8 MHz to 1 3 7 MHz and supports both voice and data communication (the latter becoming increasingly important). This chapter describes the equipment used and the different modes in which it operates. VHF communication is used for various purposes including air traffic control (ATC), approach and departure information, transmission of meteorological information, ground handling of aircraft, company communications, and also for the Aircraft Communications and Reporting System (ACARS).

4.1 VHF range and propagation

In the VHF range (30 MHz to 300 MHz) radio waves usually propagate as direct line-of-sight
LOS) waves (see Chapter 1 ). Sky wave propagation still occurs at the bottom end of the VHF range (up to about 50 MHz depending upon solar activity) but at the frequencies used for aircraft communication, reflection from the ionosphere is exceptionally rare. Communication by strict line-of-sight (LOS) paths, augmented on occasions by diffraction and reflection, imposes a limit on the working range . that can be obtained. It should also be evident that the range will be dependent on the height of an aircraft above the ground; the greater this is the further the range will be. The maximum line-of-sight (LOS) distance see Figure 4. 1 ) between an aircraft and a ground station, in nautical miles (nm), is given by the relationship:

where h i s the aircraft' s altitude i n feet above ground (assumed to be flat terrain).

Example 4.1

Determine the maximum line-of-sight distance when an aircraft is flying at a height of (a) 2,500 feet, and (b) 25 ,000 feet.

The actual range obtained depends not only on the LOS distance but also on several other factors, including aircraft position, transmitter power, and receiver sensitivity. However, the LOS distance usually provides a good approximation of the range that can be obtained between an aircraft and a ground station (see Table 4. 1 ). The situation is slightly more complex when communication is from one aircraft to another; however, in such cases summing the two 
LOS distances will normally provide a guide as to the maximum range that can be expected.
