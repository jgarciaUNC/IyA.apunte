An operator shall not operate an aeroplane first issued with an individual Certificate of
Airworthiness, either in a JAA Member State or elsewhere, on or after 1 April 1998, which:

recorder which, with reference to a time scale records:
Chapter 30 Page 1
• Voice communications transmitted from or received on the flight deck by
radio;
• The aural environment of the flight deck, including without interruption, the
audio signals received from each boom and mask microphone in use;
• Voice communications of flight crew members on the flight deck using the aer-
oplane’s interphone system;
• Voice of audio signals identifying navigation or approach aids introduced into
a headset or speaker; and
•
Voice communications of flight crew members on the flight deck using the pub-
lic address system, if installed.
2.
The cockpit voice recorder shall be capable of retaining information recorded during at least
the last 2 hours of its operation except that, for those aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-
off mass of 5700 kg or less, this period may be reduced to 30 minutes.
3.
The cockpit voice recorder must start automatically to record prior to the aeroplane moving
under its own power and continue to record until the termination of the flight when the aeroplane is
no longer capable of moving under its own power. In addition, depending on the availability of
electrical power, the cockpit voice recorder must start to record as early as possible during the
cockpit checks prior to engine start at the beginning of the flight until the cockpit checks immediately
following engine shutdown at the end of the flight.
4.
The cockpit voice recorder must have a device to assist in locating that recorder in water.
5.
In complying with this section, aeroplanes with a maximum certificated take-off mass of
5700 kg or less may have the cockpit voice recorder combined with the flight data recorder.
6.
Any aeroplane may be despatched with the cockpit voice recorder required by this section
inoperative provided that:
Chapter 30 Page 2
• It is not reasonably practicable to repair or replace the cockpit voice recorder
before the commencement of the flight;
• The aeroplane does not exceed 8 further consecutive flights with the cockpit
voice recorder unserviceable;
• Note more than 72 hours have elapsed since the cockpit voice recorder was
found to be unserviceable; and
Any flight data recorder required to be carried is operative unless it is com-
bined with a cockpit voice recorder.
