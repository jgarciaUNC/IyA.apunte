HF Communications

High frequency (HF) radio provides aircraft with
effective means of communication over long
distance oceanic and trans-polar routes. In
addition, global data communication has recently
been made possible using strategically located HF
data link (H FDL) ground stations. These provide
access to ARINC and SIT A airline networks. HF
communication is thus no longer restricted to
Â·oice and is undergoing a resurgence of interest
due to the need to find a means of long distance
data communication that will augment existing
VHF and SATCOM data links.

An aircraft HF radio system operates on spot
frequencies within the HF spectrum. Unlike
aircraft VHF radio, the spectrum is not divided
mto a large number of contiguous channels but
aircraft allocations are interspersed with many
other services, including short wave broadcasting,
fixed point-to-point, marine and land-mobile,
government and amateur services. This chapter
describes the equipment used and the different
modes in which it operates.
