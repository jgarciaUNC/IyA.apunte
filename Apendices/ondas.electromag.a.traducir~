Maxwell first suggested the existence of electromagnetic waves in 1864. Later, Heinrich. Rudolf Hertz used an arrangement of rudimentary resonators to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hertz's apparatus was extremely simple and comprised two resonant loops, one for transmitting and the other for receiving. Each loop acted both as a tuned circuit and as a resonant antenna (or 'aerial').

Hertz's transmitting loop was excited by means of an induction coil and battery. Some of the energy radiated by the transmitting loop was intercepted by the receiving loop and the received energy was conveyed to a spark gap where it could be released as an arc. The energy radiated by the transmitting loop was in the form of an electromagnetic wav e- a wave that has both electric and magnetic field components and that travels at the speed of light.

In 1894, Marconi demonstrated the commercial potential of the phenomenon that Maxwell predicted and Hertz actually used in his apparatus. It was also Marconi that made radio a reality by pioneering the development of telegraphy without wires (i.e. 'wireless'). 

Marconi was able to demonstrate very effectively that information could be exchanged between distant locations without the need for a 'land line'.

Marconi's system of wireless telegraphy proved to be invaluable for manttme communications (ship to ship and ship to shore) and was to be instrumental in saving many lives. The military applications of radio were first exploited during the First World War ( 1914 to 1918) and, during that period, radio was first used in aircraft.

This first chapter has been designed to set the scene and to provide you with an introduction to the principles of radio communication systems. The various topics are developed more fully in the later chapters but the information provided here is designed to provide you with a starting point for the theory that follows.
